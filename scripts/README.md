# RNA-seq Quality Control Pipeline (FastQC + MultiQC)

This repository contains modular scripts to run quality control (QC) on RNA-seq data using **FastQC** and **MultiQC**, with support for:

- **Paired-end (pe)** read detection
- **Single-end (se)** read analysis
- **Automated logging** of missing or mispaired files

---

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

Install and ensure the following tools are in your `$PATH`:

- [`FastQC`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)
- [`MultiQC`](https://multiqc.info/)

Install via Conda (recommended):

```bash
conda install -c bioconda fastqc multiqc
```

## ðŸ§ª **Usage**

## ðŸ§¬ 1. Paired-End QC
Use when your FASTQ filenames follow a paired convention (e.g.,```_R1/_R2``` or```_1/_2```).

```bash
bash fastqc_pe.sh
```
Edit paths inside 'fastqc_pe.sh':

-```BASE_DIR``` â€“ Folder with raw FASTQ files

-```FASTQC_OUT``` â€“ Output path for FastQC reports

-```MULTIQC_OUT``` â€“ Output path for MultiQC report

**What it does:**

 -Detects PE files and verifies mate pairs

 -Runs FastQC on valid PE reads

 -Logs missing or unmatched files to ```missing_or_mispaired_pe.log```

 -Summarizes results via MultiQC


## ðŸ”¬ 2. Single-End QC
Use when you have only one FASTQ file per sample.

```bash
bash fastqc_se.sh
```
Edit paths inside 'fastqc_se.sh':

-```BASE_DIR```, ```FASTQC_OUT```, ```MULTIQC_OUT```, ```LOG_FILE```

**What it does:**

-Runs FastQC on all SE reads

-Skips ```_R2``` or ```_2``` files

-Logs ignored files to ```ignored_nonfastq_se.log```

-Summarizes results with MultiQC

## ðŸ“Š  Output
Each script generates:

 - FastQC Reports: HTML and zipped summaries

 - MultiQC Summary: ```multiqc_report.html```

 - Log files:
   -```missing_or_mispaired_pe.log```
   -```ignored_nonfastq_se.log```

## ðŸ§¼ Cleanup
To remove all outputs before a fresh run:
```bash
rm -rf /path/to/output/fastqc_se /path/to/output/multiqc_se
rm -rf /path/to/output/fastqc_se /path/to/output/multiqc_se
rm missing_or_mispaired_se.log ignored_nonfastq_se.log
```
> The RNA-seq data quality control was performed using custom Bash scripts built around FastQC and MultiQC.
